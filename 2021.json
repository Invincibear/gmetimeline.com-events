Kelleher, President and Chief Executive Officer of Better Markets, issued the following statement in response to revelations that CNBC omitted one key part of the recent U.S. House Financial Services Committee (HFSC) hearing on GameStop and related issues. CNBC’s deleted footage included Kelleher’s call for the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to examine whether to designate Citadel Securities (Citadel) as systemically important, given the firm’s substantial presence throughout the U.S. equities and options markets. Such a designation, if made, would subject Citadel to substantial additional regulatory scrutiny.\n\nA side-by-side comparison of CNBC’s incomplete version of the hearing and the official complete version released by the U.S. House Financial Services Committee confirms this deletion: Compare the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imRzHXRq80I&t=9454s&ab_channel=U.S.HouseCommitteeonFinancialServices\" target=\"_blank\">video posted by HFSC</a> (includes Kelleher’s full comments on the need to carefully scrutinize Citadel) with the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2DU6DXfGPM&t=9145s&ab_channel=CNBCTelevision\" target=\"_blank\">video posted by CNBC</a> (which abruptly cuts off Kelleher’s comments and inexplicably jumps ahead approximately 10 minutes).",

Gamestop aims to cash in on the increase in its share prices after the Reddit-driven rally in its shares earlier this year. The sale of shares by the US based video gaming company will infuse adequate liquidity to cover its debt and is expected to lead to a business transformation.\n\nAccording to S&P &quot;A successful offering would provide additional funds for GameStop to invest in its digital strategy to adapt its business model to evolving market conditions.&quot; The rating agency emphasized that the proceeds from the share offering will help Gamestop reinvent its business model.\n\nThe sale of the 3.5mn shares which represents ~5% of its outstanding stock could fetch GameStop up to $654mn based on Monday’s closing price of $186.95. Gamestop had also reported a 11% increase in its sales through 9 weeks ended April 3, 2021. While Gamestop stands to benefit from the demand for software and accessories in the near-term, the rating agency took note of the weaker than expected 4Q results and the risks to its strategy as the company transitions to the digital gaming strategies from the physical games.",

      "description": "<img src=\"/img/20210503-GME.png\" width=\"615\" height=\"464\" loading=\"lazy\">On April 30, 2021, GameStop completed its voluntary early redemption of $216.4 million in principal amount of its 10.0% Senior Notes due 2023. This voluntary early redemption covered the entire amount of the outstanding 10% Senior Notes, which represented all of the Company’s long-term debt. A big part of the bear thesis was that GameStop would default on the senior notes due 2021, and here GameStop paid off in full even their debt due 2023. Paying off these debts frees the company to perform actions like making acquisitions and issuing dividends.\n\n$GME price declined ~$15/share in response to the good news, as is tradition <sub><em>/s</em></sub>",

The Firm was one of two firms appointed as lead counsel of the antitrust tranche.\n\nThe Firm represents a proposed class of retail investors against 35 defendants, including Robinhood, E*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, Melvin Capital, Citadel, Sequoia Capital, and others. Plaintiffs allege that they and other retail investors continue to be injured due to a large, overarching conspiracy among the defendants to stop them from buying stocks in open and fair public securities markets. Plaintiffs contend that the purpose and effect of the scheme was to shield hedge funds, venture capitalists, and institutional investors from massive losses they had exposed themselves to due to their highly speculative short selling strategies. Plaintiffs bring claims under the federal and state antitrust laws as well as other state laws and common law.",

      "description": "In advance of today’s open meeting, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved two final rules related to margin requirements for uncleared swaps for swap dealers (SD) and major swap participants (MSP).\n\nThe Commission unanimously approved a final rule that amends the CFTC Margin Rule’s definition of material swaps exposure (MSE) by revising the method for calculating the average aggregate notional amount of uncleared swaps and other financial products (AANA) for determining MSE.  More specifically, the final rule changes the period for calculating AANA from June, July, and August of the prior year, to March, April, and May of the current year, requiring the averaging of month-end AANA instead of daily AANA over the three-month calculation period. The final rule also establishes September 1 of each year as the date for determining MSE after the end of the phased compliance schedule for initial margin (IM).\n\nThese amendments to the definition of MSE align the CFTC Margin Rule with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the International Organization of Securities Commissions’ Framework for margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives (BCBS/IOSCO Framework) with respect to the method of calculation of AANA for determining whether an entity comes within the scope of the IM requirements at the end of the last phase of compliance with the margin requirements and the timing of compliance after the last phase of compliance.\n\nIn addition, the final rule amends the CFTC Margin Rule to allow SDs and MSPs subject to the rule to use the risk-based model calculation of IM of a counterparty that is a CFTC-registered SD or MSP to determine the amount of IM to be collected from the counterparty and to determine whether the IM threshold amount for the exchange of IM has been exceeded such that documentation concerning the collection, posting, and custody of IM would be required.\n\nThe rule is effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register.",

She cited the company’s strong cash balance, fiscal first-quarter results, and the new leadership in a note to clients.\n\n“We expect GameStop’s transformation to a more digitally led business to follow directly on changes in leadership and a reconstituting of the org structure,” she wrote. “We’re monitoring the human capital changes closely as clues for what the new vision for the business will be. In the interim, the bal sheet is being reinforced and the company’s social, PR, and individual investor focus is a sign of clear recognition of their audience. The gamer remains a strong supporter – both as a consumer and investor.”",

      "description": "&quot;I have written previously for the Prospect about the frenzy over GameStop (GME), the video game and electronics company. By now, you know the story. Millions of retail investors made the stock soar by over 1,000 percent in January 2021. This brought disaster upon a handful of hedge funds that had bet on GameStop’s stock to drop. According to Markets Insider, one analyst estimated losses in February of roughly $19 billion. The hedge fund Melvin Capital reportedly closed out its position after taking a drubbing of 51 percent. Another fund, Maplelane, lost 40 percent.\n\nThe rally eventually subsided, and the stock fell, though it remains well above its original price. But as retail investors looked into the details in the aftermath, they found telltale signs of a common yet egregious trading fraud by major brokers and hedge funds, which evaded what could have been far bigger losses. What happened around GameStop can be explained only by massive counterfeiting of shares.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which along with other regulators could confirm whether the patterns seen in GameStop trading constitute fraud, has known about and largely ignored practices like this for years. The financial media also ignores this systemic corruption.&quot;",

The median backtesting deficiency for the quarter was $3.3 million, which included a maximum backtesting deficiency incurred on\nJanuary 22, 2021, for $1.06 billion.

      "description": "The eviction moratorium, issued by the CDC under the new President Biden administration, was struck down by the Supreme Court. This removes the federal-level preventions imposed on landlords from evicting non-paying renters from their properties. During the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions were placed on landlords preventing them from evicting tenants during the health crisis, while assistance programs were made available to renters. Now that the federal eviction moratorium is not longer in effect, if the state allows it, renters are now being evicted.\n\nOf the ~3 million who potentially might be evicted, this will create nearly as many vacancies that landlords will need to refill. The pool of renters seeking living accommodations could potentially fill with mostly renters who were evicted. Landlords would prefer to rent to tenants who were not evicted due to a non-payment, making it difficult to rent their properties. This could result in further lost income, leading possibly to foreclosure on some properties which could tank house prices and the derivatives built on top of them.",

I found underneath the photograph, it stated “Benson says about his work with The Beatles, “Some assignments I feel I could go back and improve on, but not The Beatles, I don’t think I could have bettered it.” He then says about Beatles’ Pillow Fight in particular, “With most of my pictures I think I could have done better, but this was the perfect moment, it won’t happen again. I got it.”&quot;",

But the claim fails from its inception and in fact has nothing to do with competition at all, Citadel argues.\n\n",

      "description": "A number of documents were filed by the plaintiffs in the multi-district litigation on September 21, 2021. These documents include not only the response to the defendants’ motion to dismiss the antitrust tranche complaint, but also several amended complaints.\n\nThe plaintiffs explain that this case is about individual investors who invested their money in the stock market and were stripped of their rights to control their own investments. The traders accuse the defendants and other market players of hatching an anticompetitive scheme to restrict Retail Investors’ access to the stock market and prevent the market from operating freely and fairly.\n\nAccording to the traders, the defendants did so to protect each other, and to stop the hemorrhaging losses incurred by the Market Maker Defendants as a result of their accumulation of large short positions.",
