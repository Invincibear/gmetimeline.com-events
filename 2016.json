There is no impact on the Ba1 Corporate Family Rating, SGL-1 Speculative Grade Liquidity rating, or the stable outlook.\n\n&quot;We believe the bulk of the proposed debt issuance will fund tactical acquisitions, with GameStop indicating it was in the process of acquiring two AT&T resellers with a combined total of between 450-500 locations,&quot; stated Moody's Vice President Charlie O'Shea. &quot;These potential acquisitions are in line with our view that GameStop is prudently diversifying its business,&quot; continued O'Shea. &quot;We believe pro forma metrics will initially weaken due to this, however will remain well within our band of tolerance for the rating.&quot;",
